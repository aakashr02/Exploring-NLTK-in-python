This is my hands on experience of NLP where I've explored text processing using the NLTK package in python. 

Before we jump into coding here are a few concepts to remember - 

#### Tokenization - 
Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into individual words or phrases, also known as tokens. It is the first step in text processing and it helps to split the text into meaningful segments for further analysis.

#### Stemming - 
Stemming is the process of reducing words to their root form, also known as the stem. The goal of stemming is to standardize related words so that they can be more easily analyzed together. For example 'going' and 'go' are stemmed to 'go' and 'went' is stemmed to 'went'.
 
#### Lemmatization - 
Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base form, also known as the lemma. The goal of lemmatization is similar to stemming, which is to standardize related words even based on meaning. For example 'going', 'go' and 'went' is lemmatized to 'went'.

#### POS Tagging - 
In this the tokens from a sentence is are tagged based on parts of speech, that is the functionality of the word in the sentence (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc.)

#### Stop Words - 
Stop words are a set of commonly used words in a language that are generally considered to be less important or irrelevant for natural language processing tasks. For example 'a', 'the' , 'and' don't convey significant meaning
